Grow your own crystals with customizable colors and properties!
</center>

---

Grow your own crystals with customizable colors, where each crystal can have up to 3 differently colored layers, add custom properties to the crystal, such as making it glow or even turning your crystals into candies!

- Use the crystal growing toolkit to make a crystal seed (can be traded from piglins or stolen from their bastions (if you're bold enough))
- Grow the crystal seed by placing it into water and feeding it with crystalline solution
- The solution can be crafted using the toolkit, a crystal base (quartz, amethyst or diamond), one or two dyes and a powdery substance (optional)
- Each powdery substance adds its own unique effects to the crystal, find out what each of them does!
- The solution takes some time to dissolve and form the crystal, so take your time, and don't forget to hydrate the crystal when needed!
- WARNING: THE CRYSTAL CANNOT BE MOVED AFTER PLACING WITHOUT IT BEING BROKEN
- The crystal clusters formed on it, however, can be safely moved, as well as crafted into a full block
